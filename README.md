# SaaS @ NTUA
## This a project for the saas course @ NTUA.

This repository contains two different implementations of a simpler StackExchange clone:

- The first implementation was built using Software as a Service (SOA) practises
- while the second implementation was built using Microservices

Also this repository contains a frontend to support these two backends.
